  # Friction Stir Welding Quality Monitoring Using Time–Frequency DSP Features and Supervised Learning
  
**Inspiration**: One of the reasons I chose Friction Stir Welding, Digital Signal Processing, and Machine Learning to be used in this project is that as of writing this I specialize in AI and Controls and will likely pursue research in FSW at Vanderbilt University this Fall. However, I am very interested in interdisciplinary research, as most applications these days and the changing career market requires one to use multiple skillsets. As a result, I figured this project would bridge my MS and PhD coursework serve as glimpse ahead for the PhD and a mini-capstone for the MSc. Anyways, this is just a glimpse into my thinking and will not be in the proposal. 

The abstract will be posted here as soon as I start writing my paper. (ballpark 3/6 - 3/12)
